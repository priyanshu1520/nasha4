                    <p>Therapists who specialize in addiction recovery often assist individuals in setting achievable
                        short-term goals while working to overcome addiction. Upon achieving sobriety, they help develop
                        adaptive skills to restore physical and
                        emotional health. Collaborating with a therapist can aid in establishing long-term goals, such
                        as repairing relationships, taking responsibility for past actions, and alleviating guilt
                        stemming from addiction.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are presently struggling with drug addiction and seeking to cease drug use due to the
                        unmanageability of your life, drug addiction counseling will likely be a fundamental aspect of
                        your recovery process.</p>

                    <p>Online counselling offers numerous advantages. Upon receiving counselling, individuals often
                        notice significant personal changes. It promotes a sense of calmness, relaxation, and increased
                        vitality. Let's explore some of the benefits:</p>

                    <h2>Leads to Self-discovery</h2>
                    <p>Individual counselling facilitates self-discovery. Understanding oneself is crucial for leading a
                        peaceful and successful life. Online counselling sessions can help individuals realize their
                        true worth and potential.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Develop Confidence, Hope, and Encouragement</h2>
                    <p>Counselling fosters confidence, hope, encouragement, and motivation. These attributes empower
                        individuals to confront life's challenges and progress towards their goals. Confidence
                        strengthens character and enhances personality.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Helps in The Management of Emotions </h2>
                    <p>Expressing emotions and feelings can be very difficult to handle and manage. There are times when
                        you may have confused feelings. Talking to a therapist can help you in managing your emotions.
                        This is yet another advantage of individual
                        counselling and the need of counselling.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h2>Contribute to Self-acceptance</h2>
                    <p>You may encounter situations when you may have the feeling of worthlessness, and undeserving.
                        This is where counselling will help you. Online therapy will help you in realizing your worth
                        and make you take steps towards self-acceptance.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Provides Mental Peace </h2>
                    <p>Mental peace is something that everyone wishes to claim these days. We think of making our life
                        peaceful but it can truly be in peace when you will have mental peace. This is one of
                        the counselling benefits. It will clear out unnecessary
                        stuff from your mind and help you to relax. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2> Improve Your Skill </h2>
                    <p>Counselling can also help you with improving your skills. Skills like decision making,
                        communication, etc are enhanced by taking counselling sessions. The development of personal
                        skills is also important as it makes your personality
                        strong. You can also lookup online counselling and seek out any facility. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Helps in Improving Lifestyle </h2>
                    <p>This is one of the importance of counselling as well. With lifestyle change, a lot of other
                        changes are brought as well. Meeting a counsellor resolves many issues and you will see positive
                        changes in your life. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Give Insight to Problems </h2>
                    <p>Another benefit of counselling is that it provides you insight into problems. It helps you
                        understand others’ points and think over them. Many times we are unable to think of both the
                        aspects of problems and thus unable to tackle them.
                        The therapist helps you see the other side of problems and help you to handle them. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Contributing in Coming Over From Drugs and Alcohol</h2>
                    <p>Addiction to drugs and alcohol is very harmful and coming over from it is also not easy at all.
                        Counselling can help you in coming over the addiction to alcohol and drugs. Counselling sessions
                        will guide you to route and support you
                        in giving up on the use of substances like drugs, caffeine. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h2>Eradicate Negative Emotions </h2>
                    <p>Another benefit of counselling is that it wipes out all the negativity within you and gives you
                        the strength to fight the problem. It helps you have a positive approach in life and see things
                        from a very different perspective. Talking
                        to a therapist can help you to fight the negative emotions and bring in positivity. </p>

                    <p>Individual therapy is also known as Individual Counselling  .

                                In individual therapy, you’ll work one-on-one with a trained mental health
                                professional to work through issues in a safe space. Your therapist will help you
                                identify unhealthy thoughts and how they contribute to behaviours. You may discuss
                                family, difficult relationships, and past experiences. Your therapist will help you
                                recognize how previous challenges are affecting you in the present day. You may also
                                develop goals for individual therapy. These may include decreasing symptoms of
                                depression or anxiety, building a better support system, or remaining drug- and
                                alcohol-free. It’s a collaborative process, and your therapist will work with you to
                                develop your goals and come up with a plan for achieving them.  </p>

            <h2>How to do individual counselling?</h2>
            <p>Licensed Psychiatrists and Psychologists conduct most individual therapy sessions. But not all sessions
                are conducted by professionals, one on one counselling can also be done by volunteers. </p>
            <p>
                For example, the Veterans Association usually employs volunteers to treat veterans and service members
                with PTSD.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Pay Attention</h3>
                    <p>Laser-focus attention. Nothing annoys a patient more than a doodling therapist or someone who
                        keeps looking at their phones. If you can’t resist using your phone, use it to record the
                        session. </p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>Use a safe place </h3>
                    <p>It’s just a private room where you can conduct sessions. Doing it at Starbucks will not provide
                        the right atmosphere. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Be a friend </h3>
                    <p>Effective talk therapy is based on trust, while criminal investigations are the opposite. So be a
                        friend and develop bonds, not a case. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Let them do all the talking </h3>
                    <p> Talk therapy lets the patient vent their feelings by discussing their issues. It is not a
                        lecture or consultation. Resist the temptation of talking a lot unless asked a direct question.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Be discreet </h3>
                    <p> If you are handling talk therapy sessions, it is still necessary to act like a professional. You
                        may not be able to recommend medications, but that doesn’t mean you forgo professional ethics.
                        Be careful with your wording to prevent
                        offending your patient and keep all sessions confidential </p>

                    <p> During group therapy, a trained counsellor will take the lead in conducting the therapy session.
                        While group therapy has similarities to family therapy, it is different in the sense that the
                        individuals who are involved in group therapy
                        are not related to each other. In most cases, a person will only have met other group members
                        during the session.  The sessions of group therapy are conducted in different therapeutic
                        settings and in varying levels of care. This
                        includes outpatient recovery programs, residential programs, and hospital-based inpatient
                        programs. For any individual who wants to start anew and end their habit of drug use, group
                        therapy can be an effective option for drug addiction
                        treatment.

                                    <p>According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
                                        (SAMHSA), family therapy, also known as family counselling , includes
                                        interventions that reflect family-level assessments, involvement, and
                                        approaches. 

                                        Evidence suggests that people who have family support are more likely to remain
                                        in treatment, stop misusing substances, and stay sober.6 The importance of
                                        support applies to relationships of all types. For example, a study of couples
                                        who participated in behavioural couples therapy experienced improved levels of
                                        abstinence and better communication than the more typical individual-based
                                        therapy.7 

                                        Family involvement is important but it’s not for everyone. After dealing with a
                                        loved one with substance abuse for a long time, some family members might feel
                                        emotionally and psychologically drained, they may fear the unknown, or be wary
                                        of sharing family problems with a stranger. Regardless of the rationale, it
                                        might be helpful to enlist a family therapist to talk one-on-one with each
                                        family member about their concerns. Family members who want to participate in
                                        therapy can do so, while unwilling family members can join when they feel
                                        ready.

            <h3>Benefits of Family Therapy </h3>
            <p>
                This type of therapy also focuses on how family members can address an individual family member’s
                difficulties. For example, if one family member has a mental health condition, family therapy can help
                alter some conditions that sometimes contribute to
                the problem. When individuals are affected by mental illness, family members may sometimes lack
                awareness of how to help. As a result, they may engage in behaviours that maintain or even worsen
                aspects of the illness.1 Family therapy can
                help members of the family learn more about what they can do to support their family member who has a
                mental disorder while preserving their own mental well-being.

                        assessments, involvement, and approaches. Behavioural
                        therapies focus on changing an individual's behaviours concerning substance misuse, in part by
                        teaching life skills that help them to better cope with situations that may lead to substance
                        misuse and relapse. Several behavioural
                        therapies have shown effectiveness in treating substance use disorders (SUDs), and some
                        therapies are better suited for a particular type of substance. The National Institute on Drug

                                            <p>Motivational interviewing for substance abuse is a therapeutic approach
                                                that addresses your ambivalence or resistance to change and works to
                                                increase your internal motivation to change your behavior. It finds
                                                resolution to ambivalence using a patient-centered approach
                                                and cognitive behavioural techniques. Motivational interviewing was
                                                developed by William Miller and Stephen Rollnick to treat alcohol
                                                addiction.

                                                Under the MI umbrella, there is motivational enhancement therapy, or
                                                MET, which is a variant of MI. Motivational enhancement therapy works to
                                                achieve the same goal as MI, with an additional focus on personalized
                                                assessment, feedback, and plans for behavioural change.


                                                Motivational interviewing for alcohol and drug use is different from
                                                other types of behavioural therapy because of its unique approach. While
                                                other therapies support you along the stages of the recovery process, MI
                                                seeks to quickly increase your motivation for change through
                                                collaboration. 

                                                <br>
                                                Eliciting rapid change is done through applying the 4 main processes of
                                                MI, which are engaging, focusing, evoking, and planning.4 A distinct
                                                feature of MI is its emphasis on collaboration. More specifically, it
                                                focuses on developing a collaborative relationship between the therapist
                                                and the patient; this is referred to as the “spirit” of MI.4 This is the
                                                cornerstone of MI’s effectiveness and an essential element of the
                                                therapeutic process.

                    <p>Psychoeducation is the practice of providing those in recovery with knowledge and information as
                        it pertains to successful and long-term sobriety. Psychoeducation is typically delivered in
                        group therapy settings through reading, lectures,
                        video series, presentations or seminar-style discussions.  Psychoeducation can cover a vast
                        range of subjects, and the goal of all psychoeducation is to increase awareness and promote
                        long-term success in recovery. Psychoeducation
                        for substance abuse is not a form of therapy, but rather an important component of all
                        frameworks of therapy. Each different therapeutic modality will necessarily include some aspect
                        of learning and information sharing, some emphasizing
                        psychoeducation more than others. Addiction treatment education takes many forms. Here are a few
                        categories of psychoeducation you may experience when you engage in professional treatment.

                    <p>Relapse Prevention is a skills-based, cognitive-behavioural
                        approach that requires patients and their clinicians to identify
                        situations that place the person at greater risk for relapse –
                        both internal experiences (e.g., positive thoughts related to
                        substance use or negative thoughts related to sobriety that
                        arise without effort, called “automatic thoughts”) and external
                        cues (e.g., people that the person associates with substance
                        use).  <br>
                        Then, the patient and clinician work to develop strategies,
                        including cognitive (related to thinking) and behavioural
                        (related to action), to address those specific high-risk
                        situations. With more effective coping, the patient develops
                        increased confidence to handle challenging situations without
                        alcohol and other drugs (i.e., increased self-efficacy).

                        who share similar experiences to your own. Talking with other people who relate to your
                        experiences can help you feel connected and comfortable
                        discussing your challenges. Some of these people may even turn into members of your support
                        network.  While you’re in recovery, you’ll learn how to make the necessary lifestyle changes to
                        reduce your risk of relapse and improve
                        your life. You’ll be guided through each of these changes by a qualified professional, and you
                        might see changes to your physical fitness routine, diet and coping mechanisms. You’ll never be
                        alone while recovering from addiction,
                        and the professional staff will become a part of your support network during treatment </p>
