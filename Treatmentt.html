                    <p>Although there's no cure for drug addiction, treatment options can help you overcome an addiction
                        and stay drug-free. Your treatment depends on the drug used and any related medical or mental
                        health disorders you may have. Long-term
                        follow-up is important to prevent relapse. </p>
                </div>

            <h2>Types of treatment - </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Medical assessment and detoxification</h3>
                </li>
                <h2>What Is Medical Detox?</h2>
                <p>You may hear the word “detox” used in a familiar way to describe cleansing the body of unhealthy
                    food. But what is medical detox, and how is it different than our usual understanding of the term?
                    <br> Medical detox refers to ridding the body of toxic, addictive substances under the supervision
                    of a licensed medical professional team. This team is usually headed by a physician and comprises
                    nurses, clinical staff and therapists.
                    Some facilities utilize advanced practice staff like nurse practitioners or physician assistants to
                    deliver medical care during detoxification.
                    <br>

                    <br> Like diabetes, asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, addiction is a chronic condition that flares up
                    occasionally but can be managed. Medical detoxification plays a similar role in addiction to a
                    hospital emergency department in managing
                    long-term medical conditions. Like an ER visit for an asthma attack, medical detox for addiction
                    stabilizes an acute flare-up of a chronic disease but does not change its long-term course.

                    <br> For most people seeking inpatient or residential drug and alcohol treatment, medical
                    detoxification is the priority and occurs at the beginning of treatment. While medical detox alone
                    is not considered addiction treatment, those
                    who complete medical detox are more likely to stay in treatment longer and have longer stretches of
                    sobriety.
                </p>
                <h2>When Medical Detox Is Necessary </h2>
                <p>So if addiction is a chronic condition, how do you know when an acute treatment like a medical detox
                    is necessary?
                    <br> How do you know who needs medical detox?
                </p>
                Individuals with addictions who believe they are at risk of being physically dependent on a substance
                are candidates for medical detox. The physical dependence on a substance is most likely if you have:
                <br>
                <br> Been using a substance regularly in large amounts.
                <br> Used a substance over an extended period.
                <br> Experienced a diminished effect over time from using the same amount of a substance.
                <br> Required increasing amounts of a substance to achieve the usual effect.
                <br> Craved a substance regularly when you do not have access to it.
                <br> Tried to quit using a substance and found that you could not do so without help.


                <p>Individuals with substance use disorders most commonly seek medical detox treatment when they risk
                    experiencing withdrawal symptoms from drugs or alcohol. Along with tolerance (the need for higher
                    amounts of a drug to achieve a given effect),
                    withdrawal indicates that the body has become physically dependent on a substance. Each substance
                    has its characteristic pattern of withdrawal symptoms caused by chemical effects within the body
                    that are produced when consumption of
                    the substance is reduced or stopped altogether. </p>

                <li>
                    <h2>Medication assisted treatment - </h2>
                </li>
                <h3>What is Medically Assisted Treatment?</h3>
                <p>MAT therapy uses medication to helps people with substance use disorder overcome their addiction. It
                    uses medication to decrease their cravings for their specific substance of choice. Medically
                    Assisted Treatment does not replace one drug
                    problem with another drug.

                    <br><br> Medically Assisted Treatment therapy helps people learn how to live a clean and sober life.
                    There is a mix of counselling and behavioural therapy to help determine the root of the addiction
                    and avoid relapsing. The medication
                    makes up a portion of this treatment plan to help make it easier to deal with withdrawal and other
                    symptoms.

                    <br> <br> It is important to remember that each person has a treatment that works best for them.
                    Medically Assisted Treatment may be one of many options for you. If you are unsure the best thing to
                    do is to reach out to a medical professional
                    and see what choices work best for you or someone else dealing with substance abuse.
                </p>

                <p>Medically Assisted Treatment uses three main drugs, and can be seen below:


                <ul>
                    <li>Vivitrol </li>
                    <li>Naltrexone</li>
                    <li>Local outreach programs</li>

                </ul>

                <h3><b>What is Drug Education</b></h3>
                <p>The term drug education refers to the attempt to inform those living in a community where
                    psychoactive drugs may be widely available and or could have a significant effect on families,
                    politics, and finances. It is used to help teach
                    the effects drugs may have on physical health.</p>

                <p>All three of these drugs have a specific purpose and addiction to help with during the MAT Therapy
                    process. They are FDA approved and have variations and different forms to cater to each individual’s
                    needs. The drugs used for medically
                    assisted treatment are also not limited to these. People conduct new tests for research to find new
                    drugs and medicines. MAT Therapy is one of the most advanced fighting methods for addiction. Further
                    studies and new drugs are
                    being created and discovered to help people with addiction

                </p>
                <h3>What does MAT Therapy work for? </h3>
                <p>There is a variety of therapies that use MAT. Each option targets and focuses on various substance
                    abuse. Some of the main ones are Alcohol, Stimulant, and Opioid abuse. Medically Assisted Treatment
                    can work with these substance abuse
                    disorders in unique ways. Below are some of the benefits of using MAT therapy with specific
                    substance abuse disorders.</p>

                </p>
                <h3>Education and Awareness</h3>
                <p>Why is drug education important?</p>

                <p>Understanding the impact of alcohol and other drugs is undoubtedly an invaluable strength. Knowing
                    how drugs impact the body, the long and short-term effects of substance abuse, and the possible risk
                    factors involved are all key in the
                    prevention strategy. Research continues to provide substance abuse experts with more material to
                    help educate community members on the dangers of illicit substances and drug misuse. Life-saving
                    skills can develop from newer, evidence-based
                    research and educational materials. </p>
                <p>Drug education is not just for teachers or drug-free advocates and counsellors. Everyone can benefit
                    from the knowledge obtained from addiction researchers and specialists. It can help create safe and
                    effective treatments as well as reduce
                    the potential for increased substance abuse rates throughout a community. </p>

                <h3>RESOURCES PROVIDE NEEDED EDUCATION </h3>
                <p>No one questions the severity of the nationwide drug epidemic and its devastating impact on millions
                    of lives. Alcohol and drugs undermine health and destroy futures, especially among the nation’s
                    youth. To combat rising trends in addiction
                    and addiction overdoses, experts are creating educational programs that use evidence-based training
                    to help inform community members of peer pressure, mental health concerns, prescription drug abuse,
                    prevention strategy, and much more.
                    The majority of local outreach programs seek to address community violence and drug use by properly
                    educating residents, physicians, law enforcement, educators, and all pillars in the community about
                    the lasting impact of addiction.
                </p>

                <h3>PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS: CHANGES IN POLICY</h3>

                <p>A great example of educational resources that evolved due to growing trends in substance abuse rates
                    are those that surround the issue of prescription narcotic abuse.

                    <br> Prior to 1990, physicians rarely prescribed opioids to patients other than those combating pain
                    due to certain cancer types. By 1999, 86% of patients using opioids were using them for non-cancer
                    pain. Communities, where opioids
                    were readily available and prescribed liberally, were the first places to experience increased
                    opioid abuse and resulting overdoses. In 2015, the National Survey on Drug Use and (NSDUH) found
                    that 6.5 million Americans over the age
                    of 12 used controlled prescription medicines non-medically, second only to marijuana and more than
                    past-month users of cocaine, heroin, and hallucinogens combined.


                    <br> The sharpest rise in drug-related deaths occurred in 2016, with over 20,000 deaths from
                    fentanyl and related drugs. Shortly after, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued
                    comprehensive guidelines for prescribing
                    opioids for chronic pain outside of cancer treatment and end-of-life care.

                    <br> By 2018, newer educational material revealed the truly devastating effects and widespread
                    consequences of overprescribing opioids for general pain relief. As a result, more physicians took
                    new approaches tor pain management. This
                    is another reason why drug education is important.
                </p>

                <h3>LOCAL OUTREACH PROGRAMS </h3>
                <p>Local outreach programs tend to focus on the local community needs, however there are larger scale
                    programs aimed at informing the country about current drug related concerns. The United States
                    Department of Health and Human Services is
                    currently using a five step model to help address the opioid epidemic in the United States. The
                    first step is to properly inform all Americans of the impact of the opioid crisis.
                    <br> Drug education is not to be taken lightly and is a crucial factor in addressing deep seeded
                    concerns that may perpetuate substance use disorders. Learn more about the Centers for Disease
                    Control and the Department of Health and
                    Human Services is utilizing drug education to help address nationwide addiction.
                </p>

                <h3> Rehabilitation program - </h3>
                <p>Drug rehabilitation is designed to help people recover from drug and alcohol addiction. The intensity
                    and length of services for any treatment program can be tailored to each person’s needs since no
                    single treatment type will be right
                    for everyone.</p>
                <p>Addiction is a chronic condition, but with successful treatment and management, recovery is
                    possible.2 Recovery can take time and may benefit from a spectrum of treatment supports. Recovery
                    support often starts with a period of supervised
                    detoxification, follows with some combination of continued outpatient and/or residential care, then
                    continues with various aftercare efforts. There are several benefits to seeking rehabilitation for
                    substance use disorders. Trained
                    staff is available to help support patients during the recovery process, assisting with any
                    co-occurring mental health issues and offering guidance on what steps to take and what tools to use
                    to create and sustain a drug-free life.
                    Finding the right drug and alcohol rehabilitation center is an important part of recovery. This
                    article will explore various types of rehab, levels of addiction treatment, what to expect from
                    treatment, and how to find the right addiction
                    treatment program. </p>
